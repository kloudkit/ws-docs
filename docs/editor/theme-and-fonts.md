# Theme & Fonts

![Design](/home/design.png)

## Theme

![Catppuccin](/icons/catppuccin.svg){.doc-image width=300px}

We selected the captivating [*Catppuccin Frappe*][Catppuccin] palette as our theme and
for all colored outputs.
This choice was driven by the palette's warm and soothing color scheme, which not only
enhances aesthetic appeal but also improves visibility and readability.

These colors contribute to a more engaging and pleasant user interface, creating an
environment that is both inviting and comfortable for extended viewing.

## Fonts

All typography was carefully selected according to its intended place of use, such as in
the terminal, editor, or as comments.

### Terminal

We utilize the [MesloLGS *(nerd)*][MesloLGS] font in the terminal, which is designed to
support the display of custom ligatures and glyphs *(to enhance the visual clarity)*.

Check out the [cheat sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) for all available
glyphs.

### Editor

![Fira code](/editor/theme-and-fonts/fira-code.svg){.doc-image width=300px}
We utilize the [FiraCode][] font in the editor.
It is favored for its programming-friendly ligatures that enhance readability and improve
coding syntax visually.

### Comments

We employ the [Victor Mono][] font specifically for comments, where its italic version
presents text in a cursive *(handwriting)* style.
This choice is made to inject a distinctive stylistic touch, clearly differentiating
comments from code.

::: warning
The *Victor Mono* font is not available as a *TrueType* font.
:::

#### Opt-out

Some users may not favor this stylistic choice.
To disable the custom comments font, set the `WS_EDITOR_COMMENTS_DISABLE_FONT`
environment variable to either `1` or `true`:

```sh{2}
docker run \
  -e WS_EDITOR_COMMENTS_DISABLE_FONT=1 \
  ghcr.io/kloudkit/workspace:latest
```

The animation below shows comments in the default font and how they appear when the font
is opted out.

## Installing on a Local Machine

Fonts are provided directly through the *workspace* as *WebFonts*, eliminating the need
for local installation.

However, when accessing the *workspace* over SSH, you might find that certain fonts are
absent or display improperly on your local machine.

To address this, we offer a small HTTP server that can be initiated from within the
*workspace*, enabling you to easily download the pre-packaged fonts via your web browser.
To start the server, execute the following command:

```sh
# Default port: 38080
ws fonts serve

# Alternate port:
ws fonts serve --port 12345
```

Download the missing font and install them on your machine:

- **Windows:** Right-click the font file and select `"Install"`.
    Alternatively, open the Control Panel, click on `"Fonts"`.
    Then drag and drop the file into this folder.
- **Mac:** Double-click the font file and then click `"Install Font"` in the preview
    window that opens.

## Licenses

The table below describes the pre-package fonts *(& themes)* and their respective license.
